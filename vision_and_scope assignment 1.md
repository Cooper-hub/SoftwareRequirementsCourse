1. # **Business Requirements**
   1. ## **Background**
After a drop in volunteer participation after the COVID-19 pandemic it has become abundantly clear that a volunteer management system is needed. At this time manual volunteer assignment takes two weeks which is unacceptable if the volunteer numbers are to return to a healthy number. The majority of the assignment time is spent manually performing background checks that take on average 10 days. However, with the automated checking system that will be ready in time for system deployment this time would be reduced to only 48 hours. In addition to helping seniors with daily tasks, a new system would allow volunteers to support students with tutoring and coaching in extracurricular activities.    
1. ## **Business Opportunity**

The Government has requested a system that will help find volunteers and help assign volunteers to help senior people with their basic needs (because of the COVID-19 situation, there is a shortage of volunteers). Such a system would save time for volunteers by sending information that they put in the system to the police certificate-checking system. Not all volunteers know all the processes and most of them are unsure how to apply for this certificate, so the system acquires their information in the fastest and easiest manner and nothing else is required from them. The Volunteer Management System will also save time for the government, as the manual volunteer assignment will be operated automatically and since the police certification checking process will take less time, the volunteer would be ready to help in a short period after verifying. This will result in fast help for senior people who are in demand of help and increase the number of volunteers.
1. ## **Business Objectives and Success Criteria**

**BO-1:** Reduce the volunteer assignment time to 30%, by reducing the time of the volunteer application and sending information directly to the police certificate checking system

**BO-2:** Notify the user daily about the cases where volunteers have to help senior people for the next week.

**BO-3:** The system should track 60% of all senior cases.

**SM-1:** The shortage of volunteers has to happen in less than two or two times per year

**SM-2:** According to estimation senior cases are starting from 10K to 15K and the system has to track 60% of all these cases. The system should provide support to 85% of all tracked cases.

**SM-3:** The senior people should get help from volunteers within 3 days


1. ## **Customer or Market Needs**
*<Describe the needs of typical customers or market segments, including needs that are not yet met by the marketplace or by existing systems. You may wish to describe problems customers currently encounter that the new product will (or will not) address and how the product would be used by customers. Identify the customer hardware and software environment in which the product must operate. Define at a high level any known critical interface or performance requirements. Avoid including any design or implementation details. Present the requirements in a numbered list so that more detailed user or functional requirements can be traced to them.>*

A typical customer is either an elderly person or a school employee. A problem customer would be an old person who is using the system to socialize with volunteers instead of legitimately needing aid. An example of a customer would be Joane, a 78 year old ex-nurse who has no living relatives and struggles with technology and arthritis. A student example would be Alfred, a soccer coach who is hosting a under 12  tournament and needs volunteer referees. 
1. ## **Business Risks**
*There are no business risks.*
1. # **Vision of the Solution**
   1. ## **Vision Statement**

**For** senior people **who** need support from volunteers, **the** Volunteer Management System **is** an information system **that** will provide automatic volunteer assignments for helping senior people with making daily calls, provide wellness education and other daily things, and volunteer application for fast and easy police certificate checks. **Unlike** the current manual volunteer assignment and processes for volunteers that take a very long time (almost 10 days), **our system** will save time for senior people, volunteers, and the government, solving the problem of shortage of volunteers. 








1. ## **Major Features**
Main Features(L1): 

- Automated Volunteer Registration: Registering to be a volunteer is very simple with only data entry done by volunteers. After the background check is completed they will be notified of their new volunteer status.
- Automatic Volunteer Deployments: The volunteers' availability and skills are matched with students or the elderly to help. They are then notified of where they need to be and when.

Sub Features(L2)

- Automatic Police Background Check: The police station receives the volunteer data and returns the confirmation that the person is allowed to volunteer.
- Scouts Out Future Volunteers: Volunteers are found through outreach and encouraged to apply to help out their community.
- Sends Volunteers To Location: No further description needed.
- Notifies Mayoral Staff: Every day the mayoral staff is notified of the forecasted weekly. volunteer needs so they are aware of the supply and demand for volunteers.
- Tracks Senior Cases: In order to predict the volunteer numbers needed the amount of seniors in need of aide must be tracked

1. ## **Assumptions and Dependencies**
There are multiple assumptions that have to be made for the system to give the expected results. For example, we need the police background check system which should be fully operational and be able to return the results of the background checks within 48 hours. We would also need to assume the people's engagement in beneficial activities like volunteering which will reduce the crime rate in the city by 10% approximately. This will lead to the next assumption which is possible sponsors like owners of local businesses will offer different promotions to the volunteers as incentives. All of that is also very dependent on enough volunteers who can support the senior people that will also have the minimum educational skills, pass the police certificate, and be interested in participating. We have one main dependency which is the police certificate check volunteers need to go through. We have to send all the data, and the government is in charge of processing everything and returning a background check report.
1. # **Scope and Limitations**
   1. ## **Scope of Initial Release**

The main function of the Volunteer Management system is to add the number of volunteers and connect them with senior people. The product is intended to give benefits to the senior people by saving time, this is achieved by reducing the waiting period so that they will get the volunteer services within three days. The system processes the registered volunteers' data in the system and sends this information to the police certificate check system automatically, which results in a shrinking time for the overall volunteer assignment process. The data processing and sending information to the police certificate check is also a benefit for the volunteers, the reason is that our system gathers volunteers’ data so that there is no need for them to go and apply for the certificate manually. This feature will save a lot of time for the volunteer and attract them to these activities.



**Scope of Subsequent Releases**

For the subsequent releases of the Volunteer Management System, other functions will be added. One of these functions will be testing the volunteers for basic educational knowledge so that they can not only do services for senior people but also teach and help kids with their school and provide additional training and coaching for special cases.
